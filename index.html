      <p>
        I’m a Computer Science student at the University of Michigan (B.E., expected May 2026) interested in
        systems engineering, cybersecurity, and building practical software tools that make technical workflows faster and more reliable.
        I enjoy projects that combine problem solving with clear real-world outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, I worked in a small cybersecurity and systems engineering team supporting U.S. Navy submarine operations.
        I helped develop and refine software to sort and analyze hydrophone sensor data, improving how specialists review acoustic signals.
        I also assisted with triaging employee reported phishing attempts and supporting security system deployments.
